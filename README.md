## 🌳 Tree Species Classification Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on identifying different species of trees from leaf or plant images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It aims to assist botanists, environmental researchers, students, and forest officials in accurately classifying tree species using image data. With a curated dataset of 30 unique tree categories from regions in India, this model can predict the species with high accuracy.

The model is trained using TensorFlow and deployed through a simple and interactive **Streamlit** web app. Users can upload an image of a tree, and the model will return the predicted species name along with confidence.

Key Features:
- 📸 Accepts user-uploaded tree images  
- 🤖 Predicts species using a trained CNN model  
- 🌱 Trained on 30 tree species (e.g., neem, gulmohor, mango, cactus, etc.)  
- 💻 Deployed via a Streamlit application for accessibility
